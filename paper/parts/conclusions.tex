Presented herein are a number of simple simulations in order to 
demonstrate the capability of an implementation of the framework. We 
discuss various modeling tradeoffs encountered while constructing 
once-through and recycle simulation cases. We finish with a 
discussion of the future simulation landscape and expansion of the 
use of the framework.
