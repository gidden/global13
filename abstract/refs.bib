  abstract = {The potential benefits of a synergistic light-water reactor ({LWR)}
	and gas-cooled fast reactor ({GFR)} fuel cycle were evaluated for
	its impact on the front-end and back-end of the fuel cycle. Comparisons
	were made with conventional once-through cycle ({OTC)} and {MOX}
	fuel cycle. Variations in the synergistic {LWR/GFR} fuel cycles were
	based on the degree of recycle in the {LWR} including both plutonium
	and reprocessed uranium with concomitant impact on used {LWR} fuel
	inventory. This provided a wide range in composition of {GFR} feed
	from low to high plutonium content with impact on transmutation/incineration
	within the {GFR} fuel cycle. Self-recycle of all actinides was modeled
	for the {GFR} with analyses demonstrating that the {GFR} can be sustained
	on and consequently accept a wide range of feed materials. Analyses
	were done using Monteburns along with {MCNP} and Origen2.2 to model
	a 60-year period corresponding to the anticipated lifetime of supposed
	contemporary {LWRs} and {GFRs.} All cycles were evaluated based on
	actinide total mass and isotopic inventory, radiotoxicity, heatload,
	and resource requirements including natural uranium and {SWU.} For
	comparison, all fuel cycles were normalized based on 1 {TWHe} output.
	Improvements in fuel cycle performance are dictated by the production
	and incineration of minor actinides in the {GFR} and their continued
	recycle may not be feasible due to the buildup of troublesome isotopes
	such as {244Cm} and {252Cf.} But where uranium and plutonium continue
	to be recycled beyond the 60-year period, the {LWR/GFR} cycles demonstrated
	order of magnitude reductions in used fuel inventories, heatload,
	and radiotoxicity on a per {TWHe} basis over {LWR} only cycles. The
	full details of the advanced fuel cycle methodology and results are
	presented.},

  abstract = {As a nation develops its nuclear strategies, it must consider various
	aspects of nuclear energy such as sustainability, environmental-friendliness,
	proliferation-resistance, economics, technologies, and so on. A nuclear
	fuel cycle study could give convincing answers to many questions
	in regard to technical aspects. However, one nuclear fuel cycle option
	cannot be superior in all aspects. Therefore a nation must identify
	its top priority and accordingly evaluate all the possible nuclear
	fuel cycle options. For such a purpose, this paper examined four
	different fuel cycle options that are likely to be plausible under
	situation of Republic of Korea: once-through cycle, {DUPIC} recycling,
	thermal recycling using {MOX} fuel in {PWR} (pressurized water reactor),
	and {SFR} (sodium cooled fast reactor) employing fuel recycling by
	a pyroprocess. The options have been quantitatively compared in terms
	of resource utilization and waste generation based on 1 {TWh} electricity
	production at a “steady-state” condition as a basic analysis. This
	investigation covered from the front-end of the fuel cycles to the
	final disposal and showed that the Pyro-{SFR} recycling appears to
	be the most competitive from these material quantitative aspects
	due to the reduction of the required uranium resources and the least
	amount of waste generation.},
